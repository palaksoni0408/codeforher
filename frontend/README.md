# ViyaStree Frontend (Demo)

This is a minimal Vite + React frontend scaffold for the ViyaStree demo. It demonstrates four tabs (Dashboard, Shiksha, Samruddhih, Shaktih) and simple calls to the backend API.

Quick start:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app expects the backend to run at the same origin (or configure a proxy in development). For quick local testing, run the backend on `http://localhost:5000` and open `http://localhost:5173` (Vite default).
